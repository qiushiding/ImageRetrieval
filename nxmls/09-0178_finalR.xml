The harvesting of timber generates clearcut areas of 5&#x02013;12 ha, which are subsequently replanted and progress through grassland and the thicket stage after 12&#x02013;15 years. The most abundant mammal species encountered within clearcut areas is the field vole (<italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>), which exhibits multiannual population cycles in which densities can reach &#x0003e;700/ha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). Roe deer (<italic>Capreolus capreolus</italic>) are also abundant at an estimated density of 3 deer/km<sup>2</sup> across the forest and are frequent visitors to clearcut areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>).

Voles were trapped at 4-week intervals from March 2004 through November 2005 (excepting December 2004 and February 2005) at 4 principal study sites that were 3.5 km&#x02013;12 km apart.

Surveys of strains infecting European livestock and wild-living ungulates have found numerous 16S rDNA sequence types, including Ap-ha and Ap-variant 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>), indicating that this locus is not a marker of the same <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> ecotypes present in the USA. In this study we have begun to unravel the ecologic significance of the genetic diversity present among European <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains by genotyping strains circulating in a natural multi-host, multi-vector system and correlating the genotypes we encountered with the provenance of the characterized strains. Our efforts have resulted in the discovery that field voles serve as a reservoir host for a unique genotype of the species that has markedly diverged from those genotypes encountered in wild roe deer and host-seeking <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymphs and adults. This discovery is incompatible with the hypothesis that voles, <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks, and roe deer are all part of the same enzootic cycle but instead provides compelling evidence for at least two coexisting yet distinct enzootic cycles, one involving roe deer as hosts and <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks as vectors and another with field voles as hosts. As we have previously reported, <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> can be maintained in the absence of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks in a natural cycle involving small mammals and <italic>I. trianguliceps</italic> ticks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>), and that, even when present in abundance, <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks do not play a major role in this cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). <italic>I. trianguliceps</italic> ticks, which occur abundantly in our study system, are almost certainly a component of the enzootic cycle that includes field voles.</p><p>The results of our study are not compatible with the hypothesis that pathogen populations maintained in an enzootic rodent&#x02013;nidicolous tick cycle could spill over into humans or livestock because of the co-occurrence of sympatric exophilic tick species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Through the use of host bloodmeal source identification, we demonstrated that <italic>I. ricinus</italic> larvae had ample opportunity to acquire <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> infection from voles (over half the questing <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymphs we tested fed on voles as larvae). However, we found no evidence of the vole-associated genotype in host-seeking <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymphs. This result suggests that, <italic>I. ricinus</italic> larvae are, at best, inefficient vectors of the vole-associated <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> genotype, thereby ostensibly removing the potential &#x0201c;bridge&#x0201d; out of the enzootic cycle that includes voles and <italic>I. trianguliceps</italic>. Notably, we did not detect deer/<italic>I. ricinus</italic> tick&#x02013;associated <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> genotypes in voles despite previously observing <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymphs feeding on these hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). Because we did not remove nymph or adult ticks infesting our surveyed rodents in this study, we were unable to distinguish between <italic>I. ricinus</italic> and <italic>I. trianguliceps</italic> ticks, so were unable to gauge the frequency with which the former were encountered, although we believe that most nymphs on field voles are <italic>I. trianguliceps</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Thus, this absence may result either from voles not being susceptible to deer/<italic>I. ricinus</italic>&#x02013;associated genotypes or simply because encounters between infected <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymphs and voles occur only rarely.</p><p>Although vector specialization by arthropod-transmitted pathogens is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>), many of those that are tick-transmitted exploit more than 1 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>).Also, clear evidence exists for local adaptation, whereby pathogens exhibit greater infectivity in local vector populations than those that are geographically distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>), although this phenomenon was not encountered for <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). We report evidence for the adaptation of different genotypes of the same pathogen species to transmission by different but coexisting vector species. We are planning laboratory transmission studies to determine the extent to which this adaptation represents complete specialization of genotype to vector. Nonetheless, the data we have already obtained from our field studies provide a clear insight into the ecologic consequences of this adaptation; in other words, of what is, rather than what may be, happening. <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> has a wide geographic distribution, and numerous members of the <italic>Ixodes</italic> genus have been implicated in its transmission. Thus, plenty of scope remains for further exploration of vector specificity by subpopulations of the pathogen. The transmission of <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> in the laboratory has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>) and, subsequently, efforts have been made to examine interstrain variation in the dynamics of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>). These include a demonstration that strains from the western United States that are naturally transmitted by <italic>I. pacificus</italic> ticks can be transmitted by <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>), which suggests that not all <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> strains have adapted to exploit only a single vector species. In addition, <italic>I. scapularis</italic> serves as a vector for both Ap-ha and Ap-variant 1, the 2 <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> genotypes that possess different host specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). These observations, taken together with those made in the current study, provoke the conclusion that although the species as a whole can be considered a generalist, <italic>A. phagocytophilum</italic> embraces a consortium of distinct ecotypes that have evolved a range of strategies to facilitate their own perpetuation. Whether host or vector specialization is the more commonly adopted strategy remains to be explored.</p><p>From an infection control perspective, it is important to recognize that cryptic transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens maintained by nidicolous ticks have substantial human and veterinary health risk implications when sympatric exophilic tick vectors act as a bridge to potentiate human or livestock infections. However, our study shows the value of a more profound understanding of the diversity of the transmission cycles and pathogens on which to base estimation of the environmental health hazard: discrete coexisting transmission cycles can be associated with dilution of the abundance of tick-borne pathogens when, at first sight, an augmentation would be the expected outcome.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="citation"><p><italic>Suggested citation for this article:</italic> Bown KJ, Lambin X, Ogden NH, Begon M, Telford G, Woldehiwet Z, et al.
